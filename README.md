## Overview of programming
Program is the sequence of instruction to perform some task in the computer
Programming is the process of writing program 

## Stages of executing program
High level language is transformed to Assembly level language
Assembly level language is transformed to Machine level language
Assembly level language is said to be low level language 
High Level language is a source code
Assembly language is a object code
Machine level language is machine code
Machine code is a fundamental to computer processor
Machine code is the sequece of 0's and 1's
Assembly code is a symbolic representation of source code
High level language is easier to learn 
High level language will be in understanding language like ENGLISH
High level language is machine independent
Assembly and machine language is machine dependent
Machine language can only be understand by machines
Languages like c,c++, COBAL uses compiler for transforming high level language to low level language 
Languages like Python,BASIC uses interpreter for transforming high level language to low level language
Java language uses both compiler and interpreter for transforming high level language to low level language
Difference between compiler and interpreter is that compiler transforms entire  program from High level language to low level language whereas interpreter transforms line by line program from high level language to low level language
Assembler is used for transforming assembly code to Machine code 

## Applications for pragramming
Install GCC which is the compliler for transforming High level language to low level language
Install Visual studio code
Install GIT

## Steps for programming
Create a new file in visual studio code for each programming
let us consider the file as test1.c
 #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("This is my first program");
    return 0,
}

Once coding is done go to terminal type compiler name which is gcc space the file name which is test1.c which will be 
gcc test1.c
Now the high level code is transformed to low level code which is assembly code
We can see the file which will be created by own as a.exe
Now type ./ the file name of assembly code which is a.exe which will be as 
./a.exe
Now the assembly code is transformed to machine code

# Changing assembly file name

type compiler name gcc space file name test1.c space 0- to the name which we want to change which will be 
gcc  test1.c -o kowsarnarkhis
